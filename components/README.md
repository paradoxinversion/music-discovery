# components

This package provides a space to create client components in isolation via storybook, and author a component library via TypeScript.

## Using Storybook to build components in isolation

Storybook can be run with `yarn storybook`.

## Building the Component Library

To build the component library, ensure dependencies are install and run `yarn workspace @mda/components build`. Components will be built into the `dist` folder.
