          <p className="mb-4">
            We don't believe that only the most popular artists deserve to be
            heard - that's why we focus on independent musicians. Our algorithms
            are designed to surface hidden gems that you won't find on
            mainstream platforms. Artists don't need to pay distribution fees or
            compete for attention with major labels. Fans get to explore a
            diverse range of music without being bombarded by ads or algorithms
            that prioritize profit over quality.
