# types

This package provides common types to the frontend, backend, and component packages for conistency. When built, these types are packaged into a library that can be imported into other workspaces.

## Building the Types Library

Building the library takes only a couple of steps. First, ensure dependencies are install, either by

- Executing `yarn install` or `yarn workspace @common/types` from the project root.
